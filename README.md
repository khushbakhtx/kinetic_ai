# Kinetics AI

**An AI system that analyzes human movement, identifies errors, and creates personalized correction programs.**

## What It Does

Reality Debugger takes video of physical activities—weightlifting, running, dance, calisthenics—and finds mistakes in form that could lead to injury or inefficiency. But it doesn't stop at detection. It explains why the mistakes happen, what injuries they could cause, and generates a complete multi-week program to fix them.

This isn't a one-shot analysis tool. It's a coaching system that researches your specific issue, creates a progression plan, and verifies your improvement over time.

## How It Works

**Stage 1: Analysis**
Upload a video. The system processes it frame-by-frame using Gemini's multimodal understanding to identify biomechanical errors. Each error includes the root cause (weak muscle groups, limited mobility, motor control issues), the injury risk (what happens if you don't fix it), and where exactly in the video it occurs.

**Stage 2: Marathon Agent**
Click "Get Program" and an autonomous agent spends several minutes researching your specific issue. It generates a 6-week correction protocol with exercises, cues, progression schedules, and re-assessment checkpoints. The program is evidence-based and tailored to your movement pattern.

**Stage 3: Verification**
Upload follow-up videos after completing parts of the program. The system compares your new movement to the baseline, quantifies improvement, and adjusts the program if needed. This creates a feedback loop that ensures corrections actually work.

## Why This Matters

Most people don't know they have bad form until they get injured. Personal trainers and movement coaches are expensive and not always accessible. This system democratizes expert movement analysis and makes injury prevention available to anyone with a phone camera.

The difference between this and existing form-check apps: those tell you what's wrong. This tells you why it's wrong, what will happen if you ignore it, and gives you a concrete plan to fix it with verification built in.

## Built For

Gemini 3 Hackathon, February 2026. Demonstrates autonomous agent capabilities (Marathon Agent), multimodal spatial-temporal understanding, and iterative correction loops that go beyond single-prompt interactions.
